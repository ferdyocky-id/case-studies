### I Built a Data Warehouse so Stakeholders Can Forget Excel
If your company always spends most of its data work in Excel workbook then I'd been there. With data warehouse, I allow stakeholders no need to work with their Excel workbooks to boost their productivity, 
also resulting in centralized data analysis and KPI reporting with 1% human error in calculation. The data result is presented in Google Sheets, intended for ease of use to copy into Excel workbook.</br>
